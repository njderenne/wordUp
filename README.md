  ## Description
  wordUp is a real-time chat application for users to communicate with each other over the internet.  The user is able to sign up or login to their profile for personalized chats with other users.  When on the dashboard of the application the user can select current chats that they have, add a new chat, or delete one.  There is an input field along the bottom for the user to send a message as well as add participants and view participants in the selected chat.  There is also an add a friend button that will pop up a modal to add a friend to the user's account. Multiple users can be added to a single chat as long as they are in your friends list. This application was created as a PWA allowing for seamless offline functionality.
